    "explanation": "According to many reviewers (and this explainer's personal viewing), part of the appeal of Birdman is the subtle and layered nuances of the meta- and tongue-in-cheek nature of the story, combined with the technical mastery of the camera, acting, direction, and audio work.

    The story is almost a strange loop in its ability to self-reference, within both the actors themselves and its own story - its the story of a former celebrity trying to prove his worth as \"a real artist,\" to a variety of people including himself (and his ego), his ex-wife, his daughter, other actors and artists he respects, the critics, and the world at large. Of course, this is something Michael Keaton is intimately familiar with, being formerly an acclaimed actor for both artistic pieces and commercial successes, with this performance launching him back into the spotlight. This, by the way, is most likely where the second-wig gag came from - continuing the tongue-in-cheek nature of the story, where Riggan is performing a multi-layered dance hiding his feelings from everyone around him. The metaphors which show up at first glance only go skin-deep, there are so many layers of jokes, vague nods to things in the world at large, and references to subtle parts of the story, that new things can be seen with every re-watch. The story, and Riggan's disdain for contemporary society's obsession with celebrity and recognition provides a reflection of our own obsessions (through social media and celebrity culture) which is throughout the background of the entire work. Not only are there references to the internet, YouTube, Twitter, and Riggan's daughter Sam representing that modern vanity, but also with the theme of celebrity and fame pervading the story - constant references to other actors (Ryan Gosling, Robert Downey Jr., etc.), the ensemble cast made up of famous names, etc. Additionally, many of the actors play exaggerated versions of themselves - Edward Norton is known for being somewhat difficult to work with, in the same way his character in the movie is, and the Keaton-Riggan similarity becomes obvious at a casual glance. Similarly, Emma Stone plays every-popular-actress-ever, and, well, *the entire story is about performing a story*. Meta is the name of the game, here.

    Indeed, the film is a work of art even in a technical sense. Antonio Sanchez's drum soundtrack is fantastic and heightens the tension perfectly using a simple set of sounds which mirrors the simple camera work and the environment (both of the theatre and Broadway at large). Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography deserves its own movie, and the camera work is fantastic at capturing the mood of the scenes, the claustrophobia and confusion of a play's behind-the-scenes, and helps the audience follow each character through the story visually as well as metaphorically. Because of the single, unbroken following camera technique, the film required numerous takes, far more than any single movie, with the acting becoming an extended dance sequence, where any wrong move would require an immediate reset, and absolutely no improvisation in the scene or during post-production (which is normally where mistakes can be smoothed over). In addition to the challenge of having such long takes, where actions and lines would have to be memorized over ten-minute shots, the quality of the acting was also superb with Emma Stone, Michael Keaton, and Edward Norton all being praised.

    Overall it's just an intricate, funny story that has so many references to itself and the world around it that it stands up to multiple watchings."
