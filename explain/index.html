    "slug": "crust-punk",
    "explanation": "Crust-punk is a subculture within the punk community whose members tend to enjoy leading less-structured lives, not just in terms of things like jobs and clothing (a deference which they share with the larger punk community), but homes, hairstyles, and general levels of kempt.

    They're often the butt of jokes within the large punk community, as it is often seen as a bit of an *over* dedication to the ideals of living outside of social rules - you'll see jokes about them being smelly, unwashed, basically vagrant punks. 'Crusties', as they're often called, will often prefer squatting or living in group homes and crash pads, keeping their hair shaved or in dreadlocks (both which can be kept with minimal effort), and wear clothing styled for longevity and repeated use, rather than fashion.

    If you're looking for a visual, look no farther than any post-apocalyptic movie where people organize into tribes or gangs - think Mad Max, The Book of Eli, many zombie movies, etc. Crust-punks value freedom to go where they please, spend their leisure as they wish, and not worry about things like keeping clothes fresh, bodies clean, and deriving stability from external influences.

    With this in mind, the idea of crust-punk porn just sounds kind of unsanitary."
