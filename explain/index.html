    "explanation": "Arya is a well-beloved character from the popular book series, A Song of Ice and Fire. Young, rebellious and largely abandoned, her speech has a distinctive 'urchin-like' quality.

    The Elements of Style is a well-known, perhaps even definitive, writing style guide composed by William Strunk Jr. and later revised by E.B. White. The authors, and sometimes the guide itself, are often referred to as 'Strunk & White'

    This fictional dialogue between characters within the Song of Ice and Fire universe plays on the series' use of factions known as 'Houses' and grandiose-sounding surnames. Strunk and White are implied to be lords of such a faction in addition to their 'real life' roles as grammarians. The monk appears to be sending Arya on some sort of quest, a common trope in fantasy literature. After she speaks, it becomes apparent that he simply wants her to learn better grammar.

    The joke further plays on the popular perception of those who insist on proper grammar as uppity perfectionists by portraying the monk as visibly upset by Arya's poor grammar"
