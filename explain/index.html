    "explanation": "The jokes in Cards Against Humanity are primarily based around an interesting theory of humour, often called \"Incongruity Theory.\" Incongruity theory is an idea that humour comes from when your brain builds up an expectation towards how it interprets a situation, and the laughter comes from a surprise twist which completely shifts how your brain arranges the concepts in the joke. Because the shift is pleasing in its resolution, and because there was an exciting anticipation that is created when the joke is being told and the unresolved plot was being laid, your brain responds to the resolution of the incongruity and the releasing of the built-up tension by interpreting it as humorous.

    This theory isn't just pop psychology, however, and has been put forth by famed philosophers such as Immanuel Kant, Arthur Schopenhauer, and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Kant famously proclaimed that \"Laughter is an affection arising from the sudden transformation of a strained expectation into nothing.\"

    An example joke given by Kant is \"An Indian at the table of an Englishman in Surat, when he saw a bottle of ale opened and all the beer turned into froth and overflowing, testified his great astonishment with many exclamations. When the Englishman asked him, 'What is there in this to astonish you so much?' he answered, 'I am not at all astonished that it should flow out, but I do wonder how you ever got it in.'\" The incongruity presented is a sort of riddle - why is the Indian so surprised and astonished at a bottle of beer? - and is resolved at the end in an unforseen way (that the source of the misunderstanding was due to the Indian not understanding that the bottle's contents were not placed inside as foam). Note the stating of a contrary premise immediately before the punch-line - \"I am not astonished that it should flow out...\" - which builds up even more tension, before delivering on the final resolution.

    This explanation for at least some humour is given more credence at the rise of \"shock\" humour, and dirty or offensive jokes. A joke such as \"What's the hardest part of a vegetable to eat? The wheelchair.\" presents an incredibly incongruity between setup (eating vegetables is hard because they don't taste very good? maybe the stem is hard to eat?) and punch-line (a play on the term \"vegetable\" for someone in a catatonic state), which is heightened by the brain's perception that using the term \"vegetable\" for food is much more likely than someone speaking something so offensive (and cannabalistic!) in public.

    The humour, then, in Cards Against Humanity comes from its particular combination of a generally-offensive tone (usually considered rude for a casual, social atmosphere such as a party) through references to subjects which are often left undiscussed or un-thought-of without a very serious tone (\"White Privilege,\" \"All of the poop, inside of my body,\" \"The Abercrombie-and-Fitch lifestyle.\" and \"AIDS.\"), concepts which create mental images which are often avoided (\"Pac-man, uncontrollably guzzling cum,\" \"A salty surprise,\" or \"Coat-hanger abortions.\"), and a game mechanic which involves pitting very offensive terms against each other to raise shock value and deliver more laughs. It is often difficult to play the game in an *inoffensive* manner, even by participants who are typically polite, leading to even more unexpected rudeness causing laughter."
