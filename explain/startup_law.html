    "explanation": "The joke here is that there are many \"Silicon Valley startup\" companies who attempt to improve the problems existing in a marketplace which are due to what is perceived as restrictive consumer-protection or public-interest laws. They typically do so by creating a product that operates in a separate *de jure* category, but offers the same *de facto* service.

    The business operates in an unregulated or less-regulated space while the typically slow-moving municipal regulations service attempts to adapt the laws to the newcomer and return the system to normal. To remain ostensibly legal, the service will often purport to operate at low volumes, run by members of the public in a only semi-commercial capacity, which is usually significantly less-regulated (or at least less-enforced - think of the enforcement on tax revenue for garage sales vs. a commercial store). Unfortunately, the service often becomes so popular that it directly competes with completely-commercial services, at a significantly reduced cost - this difference is turned into profit which is typically split by the operator and the company offering the service.

    An example is Uber, who avoids the taxi regulation systems (typically a limited-quantity medallion system, requiring drivers to spend several hundred thousand dollars to obtain a license to operate a cab) in cities by operating as a hired-car service, despite offering a directly-competing service (available to street-hailing via the app, consumer-focused pricing, largely focused in urban centres).

    A similar example is Airbnb, which offers services similar to hotels by allowing \"members of the public\" to rent out rooms in their houses. Hotels are typically subject to very stringent consumer-protection laws to prevent health risks, injury or financial damage to hotel-goers, while Airbnb (being directly-operated by members of the public) has no legal requirement to offer the same protection, and instead customers rely on the company fearing negative publicity from bad customer experiences, an online review system to warn of repeat negligence, or a rudimentary refund or protection system. While it is usually not the intent of the companies to break laws, it is often the quickest and easiest way to \"disrupt\" an existing industry (to borrow a popular term used by Valley startup community), and stay in business.

    Similar examples exist in companies such as Lyft, Loosecubes, Vayable, ParkAtMyHouse.com, Fon, among hundreds of others. A common theme is the \"sharing economy\" and enabling individuals, instead of the companies themselves, to bear the brunt of the liability for the transaction.

    The joke presents a humourous template for companies such as those discussed above to operate within - first, finding a specific consumer-protection law to break, secondly imagining a world where those laws are not required and all consumers act in good faith, then creating a business catering to those consumers instead of real individuals who are legally protected.

    The final element to the joke (almost an afterthought) is that the actual implementation of the business technology is often not considered when the business model is being created (hence the ? step in the middle)."
