    "slug": "patreon",
    "explanation": "http://patreon.com/ is a system where people can pledge a certain amount of money per month to support a project, no contract and cancel anytime. It borrows some elements from Kickstarter (the site format - creator videos, reward tiers, funding percentage - is basically lifted from Kickstarter) but it diverges a lot in that you support the project on a monthly basis and can change at any time.

    It's popular for projects whose main component is free (or shouldn't be tied to money) like art projects, mirroring the original \"patron\" system where an artist would be basically a paid employee of a King or Lord. The artist could create art without having to pander to customers for each individual piece, and the Lord or King could support art and potentially get art that benefited them.

    It's popular with webcomics, for example, because a lot of their creators gain a living through advertising and merchandise (Penny Arcade, Dresden Codak, Questionable Content). Superfans will often buy merchandise, but that fluctuates a LOT every month, and there's only so many esoteric-interest t-shirts and art prints someone's closet can hold. Patreon encourages small amounts per unit (popular time frames are monthly, or per issue for serial works) and the average superfan can usually afford to pay $2 per month to support an artist whose work they highly enjoy. The artist, in turn, gets a steady stream of income (Dresden Codak's patreon currently sits at $4,390 per month for the artist, allowing him to employ an art assisstant for his notoriously-complex work). Even though patrons can stop paying at any time, the opt-out-once-you've-opted-in system makes the income much more predictable.

    As encouragement for patrons to spend more money each month, there are various \"reward tiers\" which gives patrons monthly rewards if they agree to pay, say, over $5 per month. This gives them access to, say, a live-stream of the comic being drawn, or a monthly Google Hangout with the artist - even higher reward tiers cater directly to the most supportive superfans and can include a recurring role in the comic or a chance to meet the creator one-on-one."
